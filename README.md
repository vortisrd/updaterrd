UpdaterRD is a tool used to update the Title and the Category of your streams. Works with **Twitch**, **YouTube** *(title only)* and **Kick**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting it up

Make sure your **Twitch**, **YouTube** and **Kick** accounts are connected on **Streamer.bot**:

1. On **Streamer.bot**, import the file [updaterrd.sb](https://github.com/vortisrd/chatrd/blob/main/updaterrd.sb) to your **Streamer.bot**.
2. Go to **Server/Clients ‚Üí WebSocket Server** and make sure it is running.
5. Open the [Settings Page](https://vortisrd.github.io/updaterrd) in your browser.
6. Input your desired titles and games on each tab.
7. Click **"Update"**.

**‚ö†Ô∏è It could take a while for the titles and the categories to be updated, so be patient! ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è As of now, Streamer.bot doesn't have a function to update the Stream Category for YouTube. I don't know if the API has an option for it, but whatever the case, that's why there's no option for it. Thank you for your understanding. ‚ö†Ô∏è**
